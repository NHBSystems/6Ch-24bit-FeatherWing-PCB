# 6Ch 24bit FeatherWing Design Files

This is a simple but versatile [Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification) compatible board. It uses an [AD7794](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD7794_7795.pdf), a very robust 6 channel 24 bit ADC. It's a relatively slow converter (470 Hz Max), but this board is really suited for lower power, monitoring type applications and can consume as little as 2 μA in standby. It has an on-board 2.5 V regulator for excitation voltage and is designed primarily to read load cells and pressure gauges. However, it can also be used to read any ratiometric sensor (such as potentiometers), thermocouples, or any 0 - 3.3 V signal.

**Specifications**

- RMS noise down to 40 nV at lowest data rate (4.17 Hz)
- Power-down current: 1 μA maximum (AD7794 chip) 
- Low noise, programmable gain, instrumentation amplifier
- Band gap reference with 4 ppm/°C drift typical
- Simultaneous 50 Hz/60 Hz rejection
- Update rate: 4.17 Hz to 470 Hz
- Six differential analog inputs
- 4 pin connections with excitation and ground for each channel
- On board 2.5v LDO with enable pin broken out to turn off excitation for low power applications

The board can be used with screw terminals, Plug in spring terminal connectors, or pin headers for the sensor connections
